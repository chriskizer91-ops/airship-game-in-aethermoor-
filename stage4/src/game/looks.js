// looks.js: every ship shows her scars and her life (her looks, drawn by src/ship/dress.js), kept up to date as the
// fight goes:
//   a hit           put where it struck: a scorched hole in her planks or deck, glowing with embers for a few seconds
//                   then smouldering; a ragged hole through her canvas (one close by grows instead; on a folded wing, it
//                   stays where it struck as she spreads it again); a crystal cluster dimming and cracking with the
//                   damage it takes
//   as she weakens  her hull gets sooty and streaked; her torn sails fray from their free edges and flap harder; below
//                   a third of her crystals they all sputter; badly holed, she lists towards the side that took the most
//   below a quarter flames burst from her two worst wounds (three below an eighth), streaming back as she flies, each
//   of her hull     with a glow over it so it reads from across a fight; going down holed, she burns all along her scars
//                   (src/ship/flames.js: one draw for the whole sky)
//   far off         her holes grow bigger and their soot darker the further she is from the camera (from 30 to 110 m),
//                   so a raider across a fight (or the Captain's own ship, seen from behind) still shows her wounds
//   between waves   the crew patch her up: the fires go out and the embers cool, each hole in her sails is sewn over
//                   with a square of new canvas, each hole in her planks becomes a square of fresh planks and its soot
//                   fades, and her crystals' cracks fade as they mend. Raiders never patch theirs
//   in port         she's as good as new again (reset)
//   her wings       fold back along the hull as her sails are taken in and spread as they're set (a raider's with her
//                   sails as she chases or slows to bring her side round); a Surge snaps them wide open with a shiver; a
//                   ship going down folds them
//   her pennants    stream out straight at speed and hang limp when she's slow
//   her guns        the Captain's lids fly open bow first and her guns run out as a wave arrives (clearing for action),
//                   and close again once it's beaten; firing between waves bursts a side open with its first gun, its
//                   guns run out at once. A raider's lids fly open
//                   on the side she's about to fire a broadside from, as her ports glow, and stay open while she's in
//                   the fight. Each gun kicks back in at its turn as its battery fires, stays in while it's reloaded and
//                   runs out again just as it's loaded (bow and stern guns kick back along their barrels)
//   a Man-o'-war    her crystal columns are her weak points: marked gold while the Captain's guns are locked on her,
//                   and each one blows out as it gives out (a burst of gold and violet sparks, told as `blowout`), goes
//                   dark and smokes, and she dips at that end
// The smoke from a damaged ship comes from her scars too (effects.js), and from the tips of her flames.
// Every ship's scars and life are kept on her (ship.wear), with plain numbers only: nothing is made new each frame.
