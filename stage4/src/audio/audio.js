// audio.js: the game's sound, switched on. Browsers (phones above all) only let a page make sound once the player has
// touched it, so nothing is made until the first tap, click or key anywhere on the page: then the game's one audio
// context is made and started inside that very touch, the mix is built (mixer.js), Chris's instruments
// (src/audio/thareia/sounds.js) are set up in the same context, and the game's own sounds are made into short
// recordings off to one side (voices.js, a moment's work). Every touch that finds the sound stopped starts it again
// with a silent blip beside it: an iPhone only lets a page's sound start from inside a touch it counts (the finger
// lifting, not landing), so the blip goes with every one of them.
// Chris's two files are used exactly as they are: sounds.js sends everything it plays into its output, OUT, which is
// taken away from his own compressor and fed into the mix's music bus, so the music has its own volume; his effects
// are played through buses of the mix's own instead (withBus), each at a level measured for it here, so they sit
// with the cannon. The music plays with his musicPlay, which fades the last piece out itself.
// Leaving the page (another app, another tab, the phone locked) fades the sound out and stops the audio clock; coming
// back starts it again (or the next touch does, if the browser asks for one). Every touch checks it's running, which
// brings it back after an iPhone stops it for a call. Turning the sound off in Settings stops the clock as well.
// While the clock is stopped nothing is played at all (or it would all wait, and burst out together when the sound
// came back), and with the Sounds slider at nothing none of the game's sounds are made; with the Music slider at
// nothing the music stops (and starts again when it's turned up).
// For checking: `quiet` (set while tests run the game's clock without drawing) means sounds are only counted, `stats`
// counts what was asked for and what played, `level()` says how loud it has been lately, offline() plays a scripted few
// seconds into an offline copy of the mix and measures them (sound.js's selfTest), recordMusic() records the music and
// recordEffects() some of Chris's effects (for the self-test: they can only be played live).
