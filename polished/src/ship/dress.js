// dress.js: a ship's scars and her life, worn on her own model, the same in the game and in the ships demo. Each ship
// has her own set of looks (makeLook: a few numbers her shaders read) and her own copies of the materials that show
// them (dress): her planks, deck, iron plates and brass bands; her sails; her crystals and their furnaces; her spars,
// rigging, guns and pennants. The copies share the shaders three.js builds for them (each kind keeps one name for its
// shader), so a second ship of a class, or a sixth, costs no new shaders: only her own numbers. It's all drawn from those
// numbers on the graphics card, at every level of detail alike: no new triangles, no new draw calls.
//   the hull     a hit leaves a black hole with a ring of splintered pale wood and soot round it, glowing with embers
//                for a few seconds and then smouldering; the whole hull gets sooty and streaked as she weakens. Patched
//                (between waves), a hole becomes a square of fresh planks and its soot fades
//   the sails    a ragged hole where a shot went through, its edge scorched brown; patched, a darker square of new
//                canvas sewn on with a stitched edge. Torn sails fray from their free edges and flap harder. A raider
//                captain's (and a treasure ship's) are edged with a stripe of their own colour
//   the crystals each cluster dims where it's hit and white cracks craze its crystals and darken its furnace windows;
//                failing, they all sputter together (and so do the ship's glows, sparks and lamps: build.js). Marked (a
//                Man-o'-war the Captain's guns are locked on to), their edges glow gold
// and what moves (each piece's rig, written as she's built: src/ship/kit.js), worked out from her numbers as she's drawn:
//   the wings    her wing sails, their yards, spikes and ropes fold back along the hull as her sails are taken in
//                (uFold), and spread wide again; a Surge snaps them right open with a shiver
//   the guns     her gun-port lids swing open bow first as she clears for action and each gun runs out once its lid is
//                up (uGun); a gun kicks back in at its own turn as its battery fires (uFire: the rippling broadside),
//                stays in while it's reloaded and runs out again just as it's loaded (uReady); her bow and stern guns
//                kick back along their barrels
//   the pennants stream out straight at speed and hang limp when she's slow (uWind)
// Where a shot struck is put on the model here too (hullPoint, wingPoint): on the planks, or on the canvas itself,
// wherever her wings are. The game keeps each ship's scars and life up to date as she flies, fights, is hit, patched and
// sinks (src/game/looks.js); the ships demo shows them New, Battered or Wrecked (wearPreset), and lets her sails and guns
// be worked by hand.
